## What is Linked List?
### https://visualgo.net/
When we want to work with unknown number of data values, we use a linked list data structure to organize that data. Linked list is a linear data structure that contains sequence of elements such that each element links to its next element in the sequence. Each element in a linked list is called as "Node".

# What is Single Linked List?

Simply a list is a sequence of data, and linked list is a sequence of data linked with each other. 

The formal definition of a single linked list is as follows...


* _Single linked list is a sequence of elements in which every element has link to its next element in the sequence._

In any single linked list, the individual element is called as "**Node**". Every "**Node**" contains two fields, **data **and **next**. The **data **field is used to store actual value of that node and **next **field is used to store the address of the next node in the sequence.

The graphical representation of a node in a single linked list is as follows...

* **In a single linked list, the address of the first node is always stored in a reference node known as "front" (Some times it is also known as "head").**
* **Always next part (reference part) of the last node must be NULL.**
